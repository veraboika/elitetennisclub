            In this article I will explain all the tennis 
            rules in as much detail as possible. After reading, you'll be ready 
            to step onto the court and play a match with any player. I can’t 
            guarantee you’ll win, but you’ll definitely understand the rules, 
            Let’s dive in!
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">First, let’s figure out what a tennis 
            court looks like and the purpose of each line on it.</p>

            <h2>Tennis Court</h2>
            <p>A standard tennis court is a rectangle measuring 23.77 meters in length 
                and 8.23 meters in width for singles matches (one-on-one). 
                For doubles matches (two-on-two), the width of the court is 10.97 meters.</p>
            <p>The height of the net at the center of the court must always be 
                91.4 cm, with a maximum allowable deviation of 1.5 mm.</p>
            <p>A tennis court consists of the baseline, sidelines, service lines, 
                corridors, and the 10-centimeter center mark.</p>
            <img src="pics/tennis-court1.jpg" alt="Tennis Court Dimensions" class="content-image">

            <h3>Court Layout</h3>
            <p>The baseline and sidelines define the boundaries of the court 
                for singles matches. Anything beyond these lines is out.</p>
            <p>The baseline and corridors define the boundaries of the court 
                for doubles matches. Anything beyond these lines is out.</p>
            <p>The service lines are the same for both singles and doubles 
                and form two service boxes (“deuce court” and “advantage court”).</p>
            <p>The 10-centimeter center mark divides the baseline into two equal parts 
                and runs parallel to the sidelines.</p>

            <h2>Scoring System</h2>
            <p>A tennis match consists of sets, sets consist of games, 
                and games consist of points. The scoring system is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first point won — 15:0.</li>
                <li>The second point won — 30:0.</li>
                <li>The third point won — 40:0.</li>
                <li>The fourth point won — game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If both players have won three points each, the score becomes “deuce.” 
                From this point, a player must win two consecutive points to win the game. 
                The first point provides an “advantage,” and the second secures the game. 
                If a player gains an advantage but then loses the next point, the score 
                returns to “deuce,” and the fight for the game continues.</p>

            <h3>Winning a Set</h3>
            <p>To win a set, a player must win six games before their opponent. 
                However, if the score in the set reaches 5:5, two additional games are played. 
                If one player wins these two games consecutively, the set is won 7:5. 
                If the score becomes 6:6, a tiebreak is played.</p>

            <h3>Tiebreak</h3>
            <p>During a tiebreak, points are counted as 0, 1, 2, and so on. 
                The first player to score 7 points wins the set, provided there is a margin 
                of 2 points over the opponent (e.g., 7:5). If necessary, the tiebreak 
                continues until this margin is achieved (e.g., 11:9). 
                At Grand Slam tournaments, in the deciding set at 6:6, a “championship 
                tiebreak” is played, which is similar to a regular tiebreak but extends 
                to 10 points.</p>

            <h3>Match Formats</h3>
            <p>A tennis match can be played in a three-set format (winning two sets is 
                required to win the match) or a five-set format (winning three sets is 
                required to win the match). The five-set format is now used exclusively 
                in men’s tennis and only at Grand Slam tournaments. In all other 
                tournaments, both women and men compete in the three-set format.</p>

            <p>
                Now that we know what a tennis court looks like, the purpose of each 
                line on it, and how the scoring in a match works, let's discuss the 
                rules that are learned directly during the course of a match.</p>

            <h2>Serving Rules</h2>
            <p>Each game begins with a serve to the first service box, known as the 
                “deuce court.” 
                It is called the “deuce court” because, at deuce, 
                the serve is always made to this box. 
                The serve to the deuce court is made from the right side of the baseline 
                diagonally into the first service box.</p>
            <img src="pics/tennis-court2.jpg" alt="Serving Rules" class="content-image">
            <p>The second point in each game begins with a serve to the second service box, known 
                as the “advantage court.” It is called the “advantage court” because, when 
                a player has the advantage, the serve is always made to this box. 
                The serve to the advantage court is made from the left side of the baseline 
                diagonally into the second service box.</p>
            <img src="pics/tennis-court3.jpg" alt="Serving Rules" class="content-image">
            <p>Serves must alternate between service boxes: 
                first to the deuce court, then to the advantage court, and so on.</p>

            <h3>Tiebreak Serving</h3>
            <p>In a tiebreak, the server initially serves one point to the deuce court, 
                then the serve switches to the opponent, who serves first to the advantage 
                court, then to the deuce court. This alternation continues until the tiebreak ends.</p>
                <img src="pics/tennis-quote.jpg" alt="Tennis Quote" class="content-image">

            <h3>Server and Receiver Positions</h3>
            <p>The server must stand with both feet behind the baseline and either 
                to the right or left of the center mark, depending on the service box. 
                The server must toss the ball in any direction and strike it with the 
                racket before it touches the ground. The serve is considered complete 
                when the racket either hits or misses the ball. A player who tosses 
                the ball up but then decides not to hit it is allowed to catch the 
                ball with their hand or racket or let it bounce, this is not considered a fault.</p>

            <img src="pics/server-positions.jpg" alt="Server Positions" class="content-image">
            <p>
                The server always has two attempts to successfully serve the ball, 
                known as the first serve and the second serve. If the first serve is a fault, 
                the server must serve again without delay from the same side of the court 
                where the fault occurred. If both serve attempts fail, the server loses 
                the point, which is called a double fault.
            </p>

            <p>If, during the first or second serve, the ball touches the net and lands 
                outside the service box, the serve is considered a fault. However, 
                if the ball touches the net and lands inside the service box, the serve is 
                replayed. Additionally, if the server steps over the baseline before hitting 
                the ball during the first or second serve, it is also considered a fault.
            </p>

            <p>The receiver can position themselves anywhere on the court during the serve. 
                The serve must be returned after the ball bounces. If the receiver returns 
                the serve without letting the ball bounce, it is considered a fault, and 
                they lose the point.</p>
            <img src="pics/receiver-positions.jpg" alt="Receiver Positions" class="content-image">

            <p>After each completed game, the receiver becomes the server, and the server 
                becomes the receiver. If the receiver has a chance to win the opponent's 
                serve in the next rally, this situation is called a breakpoint.</p>

            <h2>Faults During Rally</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hitting the ball out of bounds.</li>
                <li>Hitting the ball into the net.</li>
                <li>Touching the net with the racket or any part of the body.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="pics/faults-rally.jpg" alt="Faults During Rally" class="content-image">

            <h2>Winning Plays During Rally</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A service winner or ace (when the opponent cannot touch the ball on the serve).</li>
                <li>A return winner (when the opponent cannot touch the ball after the return of serve).</li>
                <li>A winner (when the opponent cannot touch the ball after a regular stroke).</li>
                <li>A double bounce on the opponent’s side after your stroke.</li>
                <li>During rallies, players cannot strike the ball on the opponent’s side of the court. 
                    However, they may follow through with their racket across the net after 
                    striking the ball from their side.</li>
                <li>If the ball hits the net and lands on the opponent’s side during 
                    a rally, the play continues.</li>
                <li>If the ball touches a line, it is considered in play, regardless of whether 
                    it hits the line from the inside or outside.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="pics/hawk-eye.jpg" alt="Winning Plays During Rally" class="content-image">
            
            <h2>Changing Sides and Transitions</h2> 
            <p>Players must change sides at the end of the first, third, 
                and every subsequent odd-numbered game of each set. 
                Players also change sides at the end of each set, unless 
                the total number of games in that set is odd. In that case, 
                players change sides at the end of the first game of the next set.</p> 
                <img src="pics/changing-sides.jpg" alt="Changing Sides" class="content-image">
                <p>During a tiebreak, players change sides after every six points.</p> 
                <p>Transitions after the first games of a set and during a tiebreak 
                    occur without rest. Transitions after the third and subsequent 
                    odd-numbered games include a 90-second rest period. The break between 
                    sets lasts 120 seconds.</p>
