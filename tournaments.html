            <p class="about-text">When someone starts watching tennis, they encounter completely
                unfamiliar terms: Grand Slam tournament, Futures, Challenger,
                ATP 500, ATP 250. Then it gets even more confusing with things
                happening in the rankings. For instance, if a player loses today,
                they could drop 10 positions, fail to defend a title, and fall
                out of the top 100. It’s also puzzling why tennis players get only
                four weeks of rest a year, and even then, they might not truly
                rest if they participate in exhibition tournaments.</p>
            <p class="about-text">In general, anyone starting to watch tennis without prior knowledge
                is immediately faced with a mountain of inexplicable things.
                Let’s break everything down in detail and as thoroughly
                as possible.</p>

            <h2>Types of Tennis Tournaments</h2>
            <p>First, let’s once and for all understand the types of tennis tournaments.
                Three major organizations are responsible for conducting tennis
                tournaments: the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the
                Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA).</p>
            <img src="pics/ItfAtpWta.jpg" alt="ITF-ATP-WTA" class="content-image">

            <h3>International Tennis Federation (ITF)</h3>
            <p>The ITF oversees both the entry-level and top-tier tournaments,
                as well as team competitions. Entry-level tournaments include
                all events marked as ITF World Tennis Tour. Top-tier tournaments
                include the four Grand Slam tournaments: Australian Open, Roland
                Garros, Wimbledon, and US Open. Team competitions include the
                Davis Cup for men and the Billie Jean King Cup for women, which
                was previously called the Federation Cup.</p>
            <img src="pics/ITF.jpg" alt="ITF" class="content-image">

            <h3>Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)</h3>
            <p>The ATP is responsible for organizing and conducting exclusively men’s
                tournaments, divided into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ATP Challenger Tour or Challenger</li>
                <li>ATP 250</li>
                <li>ATP 500</li>
                <li>ATP Masters 1000, or simply Masters</li>
                <li>Nitto ATP Finals (also known as the year-end finals, held
                    at the end of the year for the top eight players who earned
                    the most points during the season).</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="pics/ATP.jpg" alt="ATP" class="content-image">

            <h3>Women’s Tennis Association (WTA)</h3>
            <p>The WTA organizes and conducts exclusively women’s tournaments,
                also divided into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>WTA 125</li>
                <li>WTA 250</li>
                <li>WTA 500</li>
                <li>WTA 1000</li>
                <li>WTA Finals</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="pics/WTA.jpg" alt="WTA" class="content-image">

            <h2>Tennis Ranking System</h2>
            <p>Next, let’s move on to the ranking system. The number in a tournament’s
                category represents the points the winner receives. The more points
                up for grabs at a tournament, the more prestigious it is. If we
                imagine tournament prestige in a pyramid format, it would look like
                this. Naturally, prize money at these tournaments also varies significantly.</p>
            <img src="pics/tennis-ranking-system.jpg" alt="Tennis Ranking System" class="content-image">
            <p>The tennis ranking is based on the total points a player has earned over
                the past 52 weeks and is updated almost every Monday. It is calculated
                based on the results of 18 tournaments for men and 16 tournaments for
                women. Players don’t have the option to freely choose all 18 or 16 tournaments
                for their rankings. The mandatory events include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All four Grand Slam tournaments</li>
                <li>All Masters 1000 tournaments</li>
                <li>Four ATP 500 tournaments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rest are at the player’s discretion. It’s also worth noting
                that the Monte Carlo Masters, despite being a Masters 1000 event,
                is not mandatory for men.</p>

            <h2>Point Defense in Tennis Rankings</h2>
            <p>However, the most interesting aspect of tennis rankings is point defense.
                For example, if someone won Wimbledon and earned 2,000 points but lost
                in the first round the following year, earning only 10 points, how would
                that affect their ranking? This would result in a loss of 1,990 points.
                Similarly, if they won again, they would “defend the title” and retain
                their 2,000 points. That’s why tennis commentators often mention how many
                points a player needs to “defend” during any given tournament.</p>

            <h2>Tennis Calendar</h2>
            <p>With tournaments and the ranking system covered, let’s now
                understand how the tennis calendar works.</p>
            <p>The tennis calendar spans 48 weeks and has six key points on the map:</p>



            <h3>Australia</h3>
            <p>This is where the tennis season begins. The United Cup and two weeks
                of tournaments in Adelaide help players adapt to the hot and humid
                climate before playing the first Grand Slam of the year — the Australian
                Open — in mid-January.</p>

            <h3>USA</h3>
            <p>After Australia, players gradually transition in February to prestigious
                tournaments in Dubai and Doha in the Middle East. Some compete in
                Latin America in Acapulco. By early March, they move to the USA,
                where the tennis world focuses on the so-called “Sunshine Double” —
                the Masters 1000 tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami.</p>

            <h3>Europe (Clay)</h3>
            <p>After three months of playing on hard courts, players move to Europe
                and begin the clay season. From April to May, the clay court season
                is dominated by Masters 1000 tournaments in Monte Carlo, Madrid,
                and Rome, culminating in the second Grand Slam of the year — Roland Garros.</p>

            <h3>Europe (Grass)</h3>
            <p>Immediately after the French Open, players face the technically
                challenging transition to grass courts. From June to July, on the
                green courts of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and England, the
                fastest tennis is played, with the highlight being the third
                Grand Slam of the year — Wimbledon.</p>

            <h3>USA</h3>
            <p>As the final Grand Slam approaches in August and September, players
                return to North America. They compete in two Masters 1000 tournaments
                in Canada and Cincinnati before battling for victory at the US Open in New York.</p>

            <h3>Eurasia (Indoor Courts) and Latin America</h3>
            <p>October and November often mark the final stretch of the race for the
                world’s top ranking. On indoor courts in Asia and Europe, players try
                to earn a few more points to secure a spot at the Year-End Finals among
                the top eight and compete for substantial prize money.</p>

            <p>Some players end their season here, while others continue with events
                like the Davis Cup or exhibition matches. One way or another, tennis
                offers just four weeks of rest before it’s time to return to the court
                and embark on another global pursuit of points, titles, prize money,
                and new records.</p>
