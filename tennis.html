                <h2>Jeu de Paume</h2>
                <p>The earliest traces of tennis date back to antiquity, though this 
                    isn’t certain. So let’s begin our journey to understand this game 
                    in the XII century. At this time in France, monarchs invented and 
                    began playing a game called <em>jeu de paume</em>, which translates 
                    to “palm game”. The daring French played with a wooden ball. 
                    Painful? Definitely — but they soon realized it too, inventing a 
                    special glove, then a contraption resembling a racket, and later, 
                    a ball made from cellulose for greater maneuverability.</p>
                <img src="pics/jeu-de-paume.jpg" alt="Jeu de Paume" class="content-image">
    
                
                <p>Before the XIII century, <em>jeu de paume</em> didn’t lead to 
                    fatalities. However, in 1316, King Louis X became the first to die 
                    after playing it. This didn’t dampen the game’s popularity. On the 
                    contrary, <em>jeu de paume</em> became even more famous, spreading 
                    across Europe during the XIV century to royal courts and monasteries 
                    alike, despite the Catholic Church’s bans.</p>
                <img src="pics/tennis-history.jpg" alt="History of Tennis" class="content-image">
    
                <h3>The Transformation to Tennis</h3>
                <p>Around this time, the world first heard a word resembling “tennis”. During 
                    games, French players would shout “tenez”, meaning “hold”. This 
                    exclamation served as a warning before serving the ball. This marked the 
                    beginning of the transformation of <em>jeu de paume</em> into “real tennis”, 
                    also known as “royal tennis” or “court tennis.”</p>
                <p>In the 1530s, King Henry VIII built a tennis court at Hampton Court Palace, 
                    and in Italy in 1583, the first prototype of the modern tennis racket 
                    appeared. Over the next few centuries, “real tennis” became the pastime of 
                    royal families and aristocrats.</p>
    
                <h2>The Birth of the Modern Scoring System</h2>
                <p>This period also birthed the famously illogical scoring system. In football, 
                    a goal always equals one point. In basketball, free throws are worth one 
                    point, field goals inside the three-point line are worth two, and shots 
                    beyond it are worth three.</p>
                <p>But what’s with tennis scoring? Why is it so strange? 
                    There are four theories, but let’s focus on the two most plausible ones.</p>
                <h3>The Clock Face Theory</h3>
                    <p>Early scoreboards used clock 
                        dials, with the hands moving for each point: first to 15, then 30, then 
                        45. Eventually, 45 became 40 for simplicity in reflecting deuce (40 – 40). 
                        When a player had the advantage, the hand moved to 50, and with the 
                        game’s conclusion, it returned to the top — 60.</p>
                
                <img src="pics/scoring-system.jpg" alt="Scoring System" class="content-image">
                  
                <h3>The Court Size Theory</h3>
                <p>The traditional court size of 
                        <em>jeu de paume</em> was 90 feet (27 meters) long, divided by a net 
                        into two equal sections of 45 feet (about 14 meters) each. Each point 
                        allowed the server to move 15 feet forward, then another 15, and 
                        finally 10 more feet closer to the net, where they often secured 
                        the point and won the game.</p>
                
                <p>Neither theory can be definitively proven, so you’re free to choose the 
                    one you prefer.</p>
    
                <h2>The Use of “Love” Instead of “Zero”</h2>
                <p>The quirks of scoring don’t stop there. What about the use of “love” 
                    instead of “zero”?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most common explanation is that the term comes from the French 
                        word <em>œuf</em>, meaning “egg”. Since an egg resembles the number 
                        zero, it became “love.”</li>
                    <li>Another theory traces it to the Dutch word <em>lof</em>, meaning 
                        “honor” or “virtue.”</li>
                    <li>A third version suggests that before the game begins, players have 
                        love and respect for one another.</li>
                    <li>A fourth theory similarly posits that a player with zero points 
                        still retains a love for the game.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Emergence of Modern Tennis</h2>
                <p>With that dive into the history of tennis and its peculiar scoring, 
                    it’s time to learn how modern tennis came to be.</p>
                <p>In the mid-19th century, as the popularity of “real tennis” waned, 
                    British Army Major Walter Wingfield stepped in. He combined the rules 
                    and equipment of earlier tennis games into a boxed set. Wingfield 
                    marketed it to wealthy Victorians, who embraced it on their manicured 
                    lawns, which were otherwise rarely used beyond casual strolls.</p>
                <p>He called his invention <em>sphairistike</em>, from the Greek word for 
                    a ball game. While the name didn’t stick, his explanation of “lawn tennis” did. 
                    The impact was remarkable. </p>
                <img src="pics/walter-wingfield.jpg" alt="Walter Wingfield" class="content-image">
    
                <h2>The Growth of Tennis</h2>
                <p>By 1877, the first Wimbledon tournament was held. 
                    In 1881 came the first U.S. Championship, followed by the French 
                    Championship in 1891 and the Australian Championship in 1905.</p>
                <p>Forty years after Wingfield sold his sets, tennis was thriving in 
                    over 20 countries, with Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup 
                    well established.</p>
                <img src="pics/tennis-growth.jpg" alt="Growth of Tennis" class="content-image">
    
                <h3>Post-War Tennis and Challenges</h3>
                <p>After World War I, tennis flourished, thanks to charismatic stars 
                    like Bill Tilden, Suzanne Lenglen, René Lacoste, Fred Perry, and 
                    others.</p>
                <p>Yet, challenges arose. Tennis traditionalists viewed the sport 
                    as strictly amateur, while top players sought to earn a living, 
                    often turning professional. This divided the tennis world into 
                    amateurs competing in traditional tournaments and former champions 
                    showcasing their skills in paid exhibitions.</p>
                <img src="pics/post-war-tennis.jpg" alt="Post-War Tennis" class="content-image">
    
                <h2>The Open Era</h2>
                <p>In 1967, everything changed when Wimbledon, the bastion of tradition, 
                    declared: <em>“If we want to honor the best players in the world, we must 
                    let them play in the most prestigious tournaments.”</em></p>
                <p>Thus began the Open Era of tennis. Within months, amateur and 
                    professional tours merged.</p>
                <p>The first Grand Slam tournament of the Open Era, held in Paris in 
                    1968, heralded a tennis boom.</p>
                <p>Grass and clay courts were soon joined by carpet and synthetic 
                    surfaces. Traditional white attire gave way to colorful clothing, 
                    while advancements in technology and materials left wooden rackets 
                    behind.</p>
                <img src="pics/tennis-evolution.jpg" alt="Tennis Evolution" class="content-image">
    
                <p>A new generation of superstars—Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, 
                    Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg, Martina Navratilova, 
                    John McEnroe—introduced tennis to fresh audiences.</p>
                <p>In 1972, men formed the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), 
                    while women, led by Billie Jean King, established the Women’s Tennis 
                    Association (WTA), proving they played as skillfully as men.</p>
                <p>King’s victory over Bobby Riggs in the “Battle of the Sexes” cemented 
                    tennis’s modern evolution.</p>
                <img src="pics/modern-superstars.jpg" alt="Modern Superstars" class="content-image">
    
                <h3>The Modern Era of Tennis</h3>
                <p>Television coverage expanded. Courts gained retractable roofs, 
                    and player conduct became less tied to old traditions.</p>
                <p>Advances in racket technology, nutrition, and training elevated 
                    professional tennis to new heights.</p>
                <p>Today, men and women compete for equal prize money in major 
                    tournaments, and electronic line-calling enhances the game’s 
                    precision and excitement for fans.</p>
                <p>Tennis, like the rest of us, endured the pandemic, with matches 
                    played in empty arenas as millions watched from home.</p>
                <img src="pics/modern-tennis.jpg" alt="Modern Tennis" class="content-image">
    
                <p>In recent years, the sport has been blessed with an extraordinary 
                    generation of players led by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak 
                    Djokovic, Venus and Serena Williams, and many others.</p>
                <p>Together, they’ve made tennis one of the most popular sports worldwide.</p>
                <p>Yet, despite its rapid progress, tennis remains rooted in tradition. 
                    Players, as they did 150 years ago, show mutual respect: warming up on 
                    opposite sides of the net, apologizing for net-cord shots, and shaking 
                    hands after the final words: <em>“Game, set, match”</em>.</p>
