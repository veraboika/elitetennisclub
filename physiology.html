            To be successful on the tennis court, every professional 
            player works on the following aspects: aerobic and anaerobic endurance, flexibility, 
            strength and speed, reaction and coordination, nutrition, and psychological training.
        </p>

        <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Aerobic Endurance</h2>
            <p>This helps players endure high-intensity rallies and long matches. 
                The heart and lungs must work in harmony to deliver oxygen to 
                muscles, enabling them to generate energy efficiently. During 
                aerobic exercise, muscles produce energy through the oxidation 
                of glucose and fats.</p>
                <img src="pics/aerobic-endurance.jpg" alt="Anaerobic Endurance" class="content-image">

            <h2>Anaerobic Endurance</h2>
            <p>Anaerobic endurance provides explosive power, especially in the 
                legs and upper body. Players need to generate quick bursts of speed 
                and strength to chase the ball or hit a powerful shot. This relies 
                on fast-twitch muscle fibers. Anaerobic activities draw on glycogen 
                stores, which are rapidly broken down to produce energy without 
                using oxygen.</p>
            <img src="pics/anaerobic-endurance.jpg" alt="Anaerobic Endurance" class="content-image">

            <h2>Flexibility</h2>
            <p>
                Tennis involves a wide range of movements—running, jumping, turning, 
                and hitting—that place significant strain on muscles, bones, and joints. 
                Working on flexibility and elasticity is crucial to reducing injury risks. 
                Every training session starts and ends with a 10–15 minute warm-up and 
                stretching routine, as well as yoga, massage, and spa treatments.</p>
            <img src="pics/flexibility.jpg" alt="Flexibility" class="content-image">

            <h2>Strength and Speed</h2>
            <p>
                Like any other athletes, tennis players train for strength and speed, 
                but with a focus on explosive speed—quick repetitions using their body 
                weight or moderate weights rather than slow repetitions with heavy loads. 
                This training targets:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The muscles of the legs</strong> 
                    (quadriceps, calves, hamstrings, and glutes), which provide speed 
                    and reliable movement on the court.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arms and shoulders</strong> (trapezius, deltoids, biceps, 
                    triceps, forearms, and elbow muscles), ensuring precise and powerful shots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The core</strong> (abs, back, and obliques), which maintains 
                    balance during play.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, being overly muscular in tennis is impractical because such muscles 
                won't be able to respond to an opponent's shot in a fraction of a second.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/strength-speed.jpg" alt="Strength and Speed" class="content-image">

            <h2>Reaction and Coordination</h2>
            <p>
                On the court, players must instantly process information about the ball 
                and adjust their body position accordingly for the next shot. Working on reaction 
                time and coordination is crucial in tennis. Recently, various devices and balance 
                exercises have been used to enhance these skills. Interestingly, it's precisely 
                because racket sports require such developed reaction times that players tend 
                to live longer than most people.</p>
            <img src="pics/reaction-coordination.jpg" alt="Reaction and Coordination" class="content-image">

            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
            <p>It’s impossible to be a professional athlete without proper nutrition. 
                Like most athletes, tennis players typically follow a balanced diet that includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A large amount of fruits and vegetables to obtain essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
        <li>Adequate protein for muscle recovery and growth.</li>
        <li>Complex carbohydrates such as whole grains and starchy vegetables to provide 
            long-lasting energy.</li>
        <li>Healthy fats, like omega-3s, which support heart and brain health.</li>
        <li>Water and sports drinks to prevent dehydration and maintain optimal hydration levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="pics/nutrition.jpg" alt="Nutrition" class="content-image">
    <p>Hydration and energy are particularly crucial during a match, as tennis players 
        burn between 500 and 5000 calories on average per game, depending on their height, 
        weight, gender, as well as the intensity and duration of the match.</p>
    <p>However, individual diets may vary based on personal needs and preferences. 
        For example, Novak Djokovic has long excluded gluten and meat from his diet and 
        often drinks grape juice during breaks for a quick energy boost. Others may turn 
        to cola for the same purpose. Interestingly, for a long time, vending machines for 
        Coca-Cola were placed near the umpire's chair on the main courts of major tournaments, 
        including the iconic Centre Court at Wimbledon.</p>
            <img src="pics/wimbledon-coca-cola.jpg" alt="Nutrition" class="content-image">

            <h2>Psychology</h2>
            <p>Tennis is a one-on-one game, but your opponent isn’t always on the other 
                side of the court. Often, the biggest opponent in tennis is yourself. 
                This is why the game demands extraordinary emotional and psychological 
                resilience from its players.</p>
    <p>For this reason, psychologists are increasingly becoming part of players’ teams. 
        At the WTA and ATP Tour levels, topics like mental stability under the influence 
        of social media and the press are being actively discussed. Streaming services 
        are even producing documentaries to showcase the challenging lives of tennis players 
        through the lens of tennis psychology.</p>
        <img src="pics/break-point.jpg" alt="Psychology" class="content-image">
    <p>One particularly insightful book on this subject is <em>The Inner Game of Tennis</em> 
        by Timothy Gallwey. Following its main premise: when you step onto the court, 
        you bring two versions of yourself—the "First Self" and the "Second Self."</p>
    <p>The "First Self" is responsible for external perceptions—how you look, what the 
        attractive person in the front row thinks of you, the desire to play beautifully, and so on.</p>
    <p>The "Second Self" focuses on your internal state. When guided by the "Second Self," 
        your body plays for you, and your mind focuses only on where to place the ball. 
        On the court, it’s just you and the ball. The "Second Self" lives in the present 
        moment—here and now.</p>
    <p>As you might have guessed, successful tennis relies on playing under the guidance 
        of the "Second Self."</p>

            <h2>Common Tennis Injuries</h2>
    <h3>Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis)</h3>
    <p>Chronic injury of forearm tendons caused by repetitive, strong, 
        and sharp loads during strokes. Tendons stretch, overstrain, and sustain 
        damage at attachment points to bones. Symptoms include pain that worsens 
        with any elbow movement.</p>
        <img src="pics/tennis-elbow.jpg" alt="Tennis Elbow" class="content-image">

    <h3>Rotator Cuff Injury</h3>
    <p>This injury involves damage to ligamentous apparatus stabilizing shoulder joint. 
        Symptoms include sharp shoulder pain after hitting the ball. </p>
        <img src="pics/Anatomy-of-Rotator-Cuff-Tear.jpg" alt="Anatomy of Rotator Cuff Tear" class="content-image">

<h3>Impingement Syndrome</h3>
<p> It develops if a tennis player continues to play with a damaged rotator cuff. 
    This leads to a strain or tear of the supraspinatus tendon. Additionally, 
    reactive inflammation can cause bursitis in the shoulder joint.
A key symptom is pain when lifting the arm overhead.</p>
<img src="pics/Impingement-Syndrome.jpg" alt="Impingement Syndrome" class="content-image">
        
    <h3>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h3>
    <p>This occurs due to wrist injuries, falls, or overloading during strokes. 
        Small ligaments around median nerve become inflamed, compressing nerve and 
        disrupting its function. Symptoms include weakened grip, reduced strength in 
        first three fingers, tingling, wrist pain, numbness, and loss of sensation in hand.</p>
        <img src="pics/Carpal-tunnel-syndrome.jpg" alt="Carpal Tunnel Syndrome" class="content-image">

    <h3>Ankle Sprains or Tears</h3>
    <p>These injuries often result from sharp changes in movement direction, excessive shoe 
        traction, uneven court surfaces, or stepping on uneven surface. Symptoms include sharp 
        pain, snapping sound in ankle, and swelling or redness in injured area. Severe ligament 
        tears can lead to fractures.</p>
        <img src="pics/ankle-sprain.jpg" alt="Ankle Sprain" class="content-image">

    <h3>Stress Fractures of Foot and Metatarsal Bones</h3>
    <p>These occur due to strong horizontal forces on foot, such as jumps, lunges, 
        or uneven courts. Symptoms include pain in foot after awkward movement, swelling, 
        and sometimes hematoma on top of foot. Symptoms may be less pronounced when 
        it is a bone crack rather than a fracture. Stress fractures are more common in children 
        and adolescents.</p>
        <img src="pics/Stress-Fractures-of-Foot.jpg" alt="Stress Fractures of Foot" class="content-image">

    <h3>Knee Joint Injuries</h3>
    <p>Knees are heavily strained during tennis, and injuries can affect patellar ligaments, 
        menisci, or cruciate ligaments. Symptoms vary from tenderness in kneecap to joint 
        locking up due to meniscus impingement. Cruciate ligament tears are accompanied by 
        severe pain. Causes include sudden trajectory changes and uneven courts.</p>
        <img src="pics/knee-joint.jpg" alt="Knee Joint" class="content-image">

    <h3>Calf Muscle Injuries (Tennis Leg)</h3>
    <p>A fairly common tennis injury, which is why it is referred to as "tennis leg".
        This involves stretching or tearing of calf muscle. Symptoms include sharp pain in 
        calf after jump or step, along with significant swelling and redness.</p>
        <img src="pics/Tennis-Leg.jpg" alt="Tennis Leg" class="content-image">

    <h3>Achilles Tendon Injuries</h3>
    <p>Achilles tendon, powerful cord connecting calf to heel, can tear. Younger tennis 
        players often experience partial tears at its attachment to heel bone. Causes include 
        sudden starts or stops, especially on hard courts. Symptoms include sharp pain, 
        swelling, and snapping or tearing sensation. In cases of full rupture, foot cannot 
        flex, requiring immediate pain relief and emergency care.</p>
        <img src="pics/achilles-tendon.jpg" alt="Achilles Tendon" class="content-image">

    <h3>Rafael Nadal’s Illustration of Tennis Injuries</h3>
    <p>Speaking of injuries in tennis, no one illustrates this topic better than Nadal. 
        The infographic below depicts all of Nadal's injuries up to and including 2019.</p>
        <img src="pics/nadal-injuries.jpg" alt="Injuries in Tennis" class="content-image">
    <p>Later, from 2020 to 2022, Rafael Nadal sustained the following injuries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right hip issues</li>
        <li>Left wrist injury</li>
        <li>Abdominal muscle tears</li>
        <li>Ankle problems</li>
        <li>Rib fracture on left side</li>
        <li>Foot injury</li>
        <li>Additional abdominal muscle tears</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These injuries are testament to Nadal's physically demanding, gladiatorial style of tennis.</p>

            <h2>Player Height</h2>
            <p>What’s better: being the tallest player like Ivo Karlovic, standing at 2.11 meters, 
                or the shortest like Olivier Rochus, at 1.68 meters?</p>
                <img src="pics/karlovic-rochus.jpg" alt="Karlovic and Rochus" class="content-image">
            <p>Being tall like Ivo Karlovic is impressive. Long arms allow you to toss the ball higher, 
                providing a greater angle of attack and faster serves. A higher center of mass helps 
                generate more power in shots, especially on serves. Additionally, you can step into 
                the ball with a longer stride, which also helps create more power.</p>
                <img src="pics/karlovic-arms.jpg" alt="Ivo Karlovic" class="content-image">
            <p>However, being like Olivier Rochus also has its advantages. A shorter stature allows 
                for faster movement and greater flexibility on the court. A lower center of gravity 
                enables quicker turns and better maneuverability. This mobility makes it easier to 
                extend rallies, increasing their duration. Moreover, at 1.68 meters, the risk of 
                injury is considerably lower compared to being 2.11 meters tall.</p>
                <img src="pics/Rochus-height.jpg" alt="Olivier Rochus" class="content-image">
            <p>So, what’s better — being a tall or short tennis player? Or is the golden mean, as always, 
                the best option? Right now, I’ll give you an answer to this question. I conducted a 
                small study to analyze this, considering both men’s and women’s tennis. I gathered 
                the height data of every world No. 1 player in history and determined the average.
                Before revealing the numbers, let’s look at the results of my research.</p>
            
                <p>In the history of men’s tennis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>7 world No. 1 players were between 175 and 180 cm tall.</li>
                        <li>10 world No. 1 players were between 181 and 185 cm tall.</li>
                        <li>7 world No. 1 players were between 186 and 190 cm tall.</li>
                        <li>4 world No. 1 players were between 191 and 195 cm tall.</li>
                        <li>Only 1 world No. 1 player was between 196 and 200 cm tall.</li>
                          
                        <canvas id="heightChart1" width="400px" height="400px"></canvas> 
                    </ul>
                
            <p>Thus, the average height of a male world No. 1—or the ideal tennis player—is 1.85 meters. 
                However, looking at the current top 10 men’s rankings, where the average height is 1.89 
                meters, we see a recent trend toward taller players.</p>
            
            <p>Now, let’s turn to the ideal height for a female tennis player. 
                According to my micro-study:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>9 world No. 1 players were between 165 and 170 cm tall.</li>
                <li>5 world No. 1 players were between 171 and 175 cm tall.</li>
                <li>7 world No. 1 players were between 176 and 180 cm tall.</li>
                <li>5 world No. 1 players were between 181 and 185 cm tall.</li>
                <li>3 world No. 1 players were between 186 and 190 cm tall.</li>
                
                <canvas id="heightChart2" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Thus, the average height of a female world No. 1—or the ideal tennis player—is 1.76 meters.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike in men’s tennis, there’s no trend toward taller players among women. Analyzing 
                the current top 10, the average remains at 1.75 meters.</p>
            
            <p>For men, it’s 1.85 meters; for women, it’s 1.75 meters. This height is not coincidental — 
                it’s the perfect balance between Olivier Rochus’s agility and Ivo Karlovic’s power.</p>
