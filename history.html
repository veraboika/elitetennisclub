            From the early days of tennis, men played in blazers and flannel trousers, 
                while women wore long, narrow dresses made of twill or flannel, tightly 
                laced corsets, stockings, heeled shoes, hats, and tennis aprons for carrying 
                balls. Today, men play in sleeveless shirts, and women adorn their dresses 
                with rhinestones, diamonds, and oversized bows. Some even play in sleeveless 
                tops.

                <h3>The Evolution of Tennis Attire: Breaking Free from Tradition</h3>
            <p>To understand the influence tennis has had on the fashion industry, we need 
                to travel back to the late 19th century, to Victorian England, and trace 
                the evolution of tennis style. As I mentioned earlier, the bodies of men 
                and women were fully covered, and dressing for the court was treated like 
                dressing for a formal event. Men were satisfied with this attire since it 
                did not cause much discomfort during play. However, women were not as content. 
                Slowly, they began to break free from the multilayered dress code of the 
                Victorian era.</p>

                <h3>The First Fashion Revolution: Maud Watson and Charlotte Dod</h3>
            <p>Initially, twill and flannel dresses were replaced by cotton and linen white 
                dresses with lace inserts and embroidery. The dresses were white because it 
                helped conceal sweat stains. Then, the champion of the first two Wimbledon 
                tournaments, Maud Watson, revolutionized tennis fashion by appearing on the 
                court in a dress that didn’t cover her ankles. The audience was shocked and 
                deemed her outfit indecent. Even more shocking to tennis audiences was the 
                outfit of 15-year-old Charlotte Dod, who, in 1887, stepped onto the tennis 
                court without a corset, without a long and multilayered dress, but in 
                a knee-length dress resembling a school uniform.</p>

                <h3>Suzanne Lenglen: The Flapper Girl and Tennis Fashion Icon</h3>
            <p>Older opponents disapproved, claiming that Charlotte's clothing gave her an 
                advantage by allowing her to move more freely and quickly. Despite the criticism, 
                Dod inspired much of the women’s tennis community to consider creating clothing 
                that was more comfortable and practical for movement on the court. A few years later, 
                tennis fashion saw a new star: the dazzling Suzanne Lenglen. Collaborating with 
                designer Jean Patou, she appeared on the court in a pleated silk skirt, a 
                sleeveless cardigan, and a tulle bandeau. Initially, such a style was considered 
                too provocative, but soon, everyone started copying it. Lenglen became a true 
                style icon not only on the tennis court but also beyond. Her unique style became 
                a symbol of the so-called “flapper girls,” who behaved with emphasized freedom, 
                in contrast to their Victorian mothers and grandmothers.</p>

                <h3>The 1930s to 1940s: The Rise of Functional Fashion</h3>
            <p>In the 1930s, Helen Wills Moody brought a rectangular silhouette, pleated knee-length 
                skirts, and white visors to tennis fashion. René Lacoste created the polo shirt, 
                freeing men’s tennis from long sleeves. In the early 1940s, Fred Perry, 
                in collaboration with footballer Tibby Wegner, invented the wristband. 
                In 1947, Wimbledon saw the birth of tennis sensuality when American player 
                Gussie Moran appeared on the court in a skirt above the knees and lavender 
                lace underwear. Photographers were said to lie on the ground to capture the 
                moment and photograph the iconic lavender panties. Recalling this, Ted Tinling, 
                the designer of the outfit and the Wimbledon tournament organizer, said the 
                outfit earned Moran the nickname “Gorgeous Gussie” from the crowd.</p>

                <h3>The 1950s and Beyond: A Shift Towards Lightness and Comfort</h3>
            <p>From that moment, tennis fashion began to move toward freedom and lightness. 
                The 1950s introduced cinched waists, narrow cardigans, feminine pleats, and 
                flared skirts. The 1970s and 1980s brought bright colors and unconventional 
                patterns to tennis, with outfits made of lycra and sometimes even denim. 
                In subsequent years, tennis fashion, enriched by past experiences, experimented 
                with materials and technologies, focusing more on sportswear, only occasionally 
                emphasizing style. Looking at all of this, we can confidently state that the 
                fashion industry owes tennis pleated skirts, cardigans, vests, polos, mini shorts, 
                form-fitting suits, visors, and, of course, the color of the tennis ball.</p>

                <h2>The Influence of Tennis on the Fashion Industry</h2>
            <p>Now that we know what clothing tennis has given to the world of fashion, we can talk 
                about clothing brands that originated from tennis.</p>
                <h3>Lacoste</h3>
                <p>Of course, we must first mention the brand of the ten-time Grand Slam champion, 
                    "The Crocodile," René Lacoste. The history of this brand began in 1923 at the 
                    Davis Cup. The captain of the Australian team, Allan Muhr, promised Lacoste 
                    that if he won the match, he would buy him a crocodile leather suitcase 
                displayed in a nearby store window. Nearby, journalist George Carens wrote 
                about the bet in <em>The Boston Evening Transcript</em>, drawing a now-iconic analogy: 
                "He fought like a true crocodile, never letting go of his prey".
                 René didn’t win that match, but the nickname "The Crocodile" stayed with him for life. 
                 Four years later, in 1927, René’s friend Robert George sketched a crocodile with an 
                 open mouth, which became Lacoste’s personal logo. This design also marked the first 
                 instance of a fashion logo being displayed on the outside of a garment.</p>

                <p>Lacoste was also the first to step onto the court wearing a soft cotton short-sleeve 
                shirt. It was this polo shirt that launched the Lacoste brand, officially established 
                as <em>La Société Chemise Lacoste</em> in 1933 by René Lacoste and knitwear mogul André Gillier.</p>
                <p>The brand's iconic polo, the L-1212 model, remains in production to this day. Today, 
                top players such as Novak Djokovic, Daniil Medvedev, and Grigor Dimitrov represent 
                the Lacoste brand.</p>

                <h3>Fred Perry: A Legacy of Rebellion and Style</h3>
            <p>The Fred Perry brand also originated in tennis, named after the tennis champion 
                who won 14 Grand Slam tournaments. In the 1952, Fred Perry released an improved 
                version of Lacoste’s polo shirt, tailored to fit the body, with a logo of 
                a laurel wreath, the original Wimbledon symbol. This model, M3, immediately 
                conquered the world. Unlike the Lacoste brand, Fred Perry took a less sporty path. 
                It distanced itself significantly from tennis and adopted a more rebellious image, 
                at one point even being associated with far-right movements. Many consider the 
                Fred Perry brand a symbol of British music, as it once released collections 
                in collaboration with Blur's frontman Damon Albarn and Amy Winehouse.</p>

                <h3>The Rise of Iconic Tennis Shoes</h3>
            <p>As for tennis shoes, many models were named after players like Rod Laver, 
                Ilie Nastase, Guillermo Vilas, Björn Borg, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, and 
                Yannick Noah. However, the most iconic were the Adidas Stan Smiths, made of 
                white leather with a rubber sole and a green foam heel pad to protect the 
                Achilles tendon. They became a global phenomenon, with 40 million pairs sold 
                by 2005. Stan Smith, the winner of seven Grand Slam tournaments, is one of 
                the few athletes with a lifetime contract with Adidas.</p>

                <h3>Modern Tennis: Personal Collections and Collaborations</h3>
            <p>Today, it is challenging for modern tennis players to establish their own brands 
                with giants like Nike, Adidas, Lacoste, and Fila dominating the market. However, 
                they have the opportunity to earn personal collections. Rafael Nadal and Naomi 
                Osaka have lines with Nike; Serena Williams even has her own design division 
                with the brand, similar to LeBron James. Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev 
                collaborate with Lacoste, Roger Federer with Uniqlo and On, and Coco Gauff with 
                New Balance.</p>
