                Tennis is more than just rackets, balls, and battles of character.
                It's also about three unique surfaces—grass, clay, and hard courts—each
                shaping its own style of play. But what are their differences? Why do
                some players become kings of grass, others legends of clay, and still
                others dominate on hard courts? Let’s dive in.

            <h2>Differences in Gameplay on Surfaces</h2>
            <p>Grass, clay, and hard courts differ fundamentally.
                To understand these differences, focus on one key moment:
                the split second when the ball contacts the court after a hit.</p>
            <img src="pics/Bouncing-tennis-ball.jpg" alt="Bouncing Tennis Ball" class="content-image">

            <h3>Grass Courts</h3>
            <p>Approximately, when hitting the ball at a speed of 100 km/h and at an angle of 30°, the ball retains a
                speed of 73 km/h after the bounce and rebounds at an angle of 36°. Near the baseline, such a ball is
                played at a height of 134 cm. These characteristics make grass courts the fastest.</p>
            <p>On these courts, it is crucial to have instant reactions, quick footwork, excellent flat and sliced
                shots, strong serves, and efficient net play. Most rallies end in one or two strokes. Players hit many
                aces and often approach the net.</p>
            <p>On grass courts, there’s no time to prepare shots; responses must be immediate and always taken at a low
                point. In all these components, <strong>Roger Federer</strong> was unparalleled.</p>
            <img src="pics/federer.jpg" alt="Roger Federer on Grass Court" class="content-image">

            <h3>Clay Courts</h3>
            <p>When hitting the ball at a speed of 100 km/h and at an angle of 30°, the ball retains a speed of 57 km/h
                after the bounce and rebounds at an angle of 44°. Near the baseline, such a ball is played at a height
                of 170 cm. Based on these characteristics, we can confidently state that clay courts are the slowest.
            </p>
            <p>To play on clay, endurance, tactical skills, and ball spin are critical. It’s precisely the spin that
                makes <strong>Rafael Nadal</strong> the King of Clay. Nadal spins the ball at a speed of 3,200
                revolutions per minute, whereas others typically spin the ball in the range of 2,000 to 2,700
                revolutions per minute. This allows him to achieve an explosive effect after the bounce, forcing the
                opponent to play it in a very uncomfortable, high position.</p>

            <img src="pics/nadal.jpg" alt="Rafael Nadal on Clay Court" class="content-image">

            <h3>Hard Courts</h3>
            <p>When hitting the ball at a speed of 100 km/h and at an angle of 30°, the ball retains a speed of 67 km/h
                after the bounce and rebounds at an angle of 41°. Near the baseline, such a ball is played at a height
                of 162 cm.</p>
            <p>Finally, we arrive at the average characteristics of hard courts: faster than clay but slower than grass.
                Here, it’s essential to incorporate the best of both grass and clay gameplay, as most tournaments are
                played on hard courts. This surface is truly universal but also the most demanding.</p>
            <p>Due to the firm grip of the surface, the knees, joints, and back experience significant strain. Without a
                doubt, <strong>Novak Djokovic</strong> is the King of Hard Courts. His ability to move on hard surfaces,
                thanks to his flexibility and agility, is unmatched.</p>

            <h2>How Does Weather Affect Surfaces?</h2>
            <p>The dynamics of tennis surfaces are fascinating, but they become even more intriguing when we consider
                how weather conditions can alter them.</p>
            <p><strong>Grass</strong> is highly sensitive during growth. If the weather is humid during this period, the
                grass becomes lush and slippery. In contrast, during hot weather, the grass wears out more quickly and,
                as a result, becomes faster.</p>
            <p><strong>Clay</strong> performs differently based on air humidity. It plays faster in dry conditions
                compared to when the air is moist. Additionally, clay is quicker at higher altitudes, such as in Madrid,
                where the thinner air affects play. This is one reason why Rafael Nadal has won fewer titles at this
                specific clay tournament.</p>
            <p><strong>Hard courts</strong> vary throughout the day. They are faster in the morning under the sun but
                tend to slow down by evening.</p>
            <img src="pics/differences.jpg" alt="Different Surfaces" class="content-image">

            <h2>Why Are There No Kings of All Surfaces?</h2>
            <p>The answer is simple: it’s physically very challenging.
                Only a few players can truly be called versatile. <strong>Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and
                    Serena Williams</strong> come to mind. But why only them? Why is it so difficult
                to excel equally on all three surfaces?</p>
            <img src="pics/serena-williams.jpg" alt="Serena Williams" class="content-image">
            <p>Young players relentlessly strive to conquer all three tennis domains—three different styles
                of play, three different aesthetics: grass, clay, and hard. Perhaps someone will achieve
                this soon. One way or another, it is precisely because of these surfaces that tennis
                is so diverse and captivating.</p>
