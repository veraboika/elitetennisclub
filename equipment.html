        <h2>Key Parameters of a Tennis Racket</h2>
        <p> The technology behind racket manufacturing is evolving rapidly. For many 
            years, graphite has been the primary material used to create this essential 
            tool. While some manufacturers incorporate additional materials into their 
            models, graphite remains the core component. However, the cheapest models 
            are typically made of aluminum. I strongly advise against skimping and 
            recommend opting for a graphite racket. A ball hit with a graphite racket 
            travels faster, reduces joint strain, and provides significantly more 
            comfort compared to an aluminum one.</p>
            <p>Choosing the right tennis racket is a responsible process that will 
                influence not only the quality of your game but also your health. 
                Therefore, it is essential to select sports equipment carefully, 
                considering your individual characteristics.</p>
        <h3>Weight</h3>
        <p>The heavier the racket, the stronger the ball will travel. 
            For this reason, professionals generally use heavy rackets, often 
            additionally weighted with special loads. For amateurs, medium-weight 
            rackets are suitable as they are more maneuverable and comfortable.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For men amateurs: rackets weighing no more than 300 grams are recommended.</li>
                <li>For women amateurs: rackets weighing no more than 280 grams.
                    An incorrectly chosen racket weight can lead to significant 
                    joint strain, so it is vital to select a racket that matches your 
                    body weight and build.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Balance</h3>      
            <ul>
                <li>A balance shifted toward the handle increases the racket's precision.</li>
                <li>A balance toward the head enhances its power.</li>
            </ul>      
            <p>Professionals often use rackets with a balance shifted 
                toward the handle, typically marked "HL" or "headlight."</p>
            <p>Amateurs may find neutral balance rackets more suitable, 
                indicated by "even" on the parameters.</p>
        <h3>Head Size</h3>
        <p>Smaller heads provide greater precision, while larger heads offer more power. 
            Professionals might use rackets with heads as small as 95 square inches or 
            less. For amateurs, 100–110 square inches is recommended, as these rackets 
            have a larger "sweet spot," meaning hitting slightly off-center won't 
            significantly impact comfort or accuracy.</p>
        <h3>Frame Width</h3>
        <p>This is a personal preference. Players focusing on precision and feel often 
            prefer rackets with narrower frames, while those relying on powerful shots 
            and spins typically choose wider frames. Amateurs are advised to opt for 
            wider frames as they are more forgiving and less dependent on perfect technique.</p>
        <h3>String</h3>
        <p>Currently, most players, both amateurs and professionals, use synthetic multifilament 
            strings. These strings are practical and come in affordable models. In addition 
            to standard strings, there are ribbed-profile strings that theoretically allow 
            for better spin on the ball.</p>
        <p>When choosing strings, pay attention to their <strong>diameter</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinner strings are more comfortable and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thicker strings are more durable and will last longer before breaking.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>For amateurs, I recommend soft strings with a medium diameter of about <strong>1.25 mm</strong>.</p>
        <p>Another crucial aspect is the <strong>string tension</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tighter the strings, the more control you will have.</li>
            <li>The looser the strings (within reasonable limits), the more powerful the shot.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Professionals often experiment with string tension, but for amateurs, I recommend 
            setting the tension within <strong>23–25 kilograms</strong>.</p>
        <p>Often, horizontal strings are strung with <strong>1–2 kilograms</strong> 
            less tension than vertical ones. 
            When you hand your racket to a stringer, don’t forget to specify the exact tension for 
            both vertical and horizontal strings (e.g., 25x24 kg).</p>
        <p>String pattern (string density) indicates the number of horizontal and vertical strings in the racket. 
            For amateurs, rackets with <strong>relatively low string density</strong> are 
            recommended, as they generate more power and are easier to spin.</p>
        <h3>Grip</h3>
        <p>Grip size is measured in either units (0 to 5, where 0 is the smallest and 5 
            is the largest) or inches.
            Most men prefer a size 3 grip, while women often choose size 2.
            The grip should almost completely fill your hand when you wrap it around 
            the handle. If unsure, choose a smaller size as you can always add an 
            overgrip to increase the size.</p>
        <p>When sold, a racket comes with a base grip on the handle, typically made of synthetic 
            materials or, less commonly, leather. On top of the base grip, players usually wrap an 
            additional grip, called an <strong>overgrip</strong>.</p>
        <p>Overgrips, like strings, are consumable items. Once they become slippery or dirty, 
            you can easily remove and replace them.</p>
        <p>Overgrips generally come in two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dry</li>
            <li>Tacky</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing a grip is a matter of personal preference. Try both types to determine 
            which suits you best.</p>
        <h2>Tennis Accessories</h2>
        <h3>Vibration Dampeners</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed to reduce or eliminate the unpleasant sound produced when the 
                racket contacts the ball.</li>
            <li>Help to reduce string vibrations after impact, making the sound of the 
                hit less sharp and more muted.</li>
            <li>Can reduce unpleasant sensations in the hand, especially for players 
                with sensitive wrists or forearms.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="pics/vibration-dampener.jpg" alt="Wimbledon Logo" class="content-image">
        <p>Some players prefer using dampeners, while others play without them, arguing that they 
            slightly muffle the feel of the racket. Experiment with and without a vibration dampener 
            to decide what feels more comfortable for you.</p>
        <h3>Tennis Balls</h3>
        <p>The selection of tennis balls is vast. There are balls specifically 
            designed for particular types of courts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clay court balls</li>
            <li>Hard court balls</li>
            <li>Universal balls (all-court)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<section class="content-section">
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>Bounce characteristics vary significantly depending on the surface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On clay, the bounce is slow and high.</li>
            <li>On grass, it’s fast and low.</li>
            <li>On hard courts, it’s somewhere in between.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To maximize your playing comfort, choose balls suited for the surface you’re 
            playing on or choose universal balls.</p>
        <p>Another important parameter is <strong>internal pressure</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pressurized balls (with internal pressure). These are softer and more 
                comfortable to play with.</li>
            <li>Pressureless balls. These are less common.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I recommend using pressurized balls as they generally offer a better playing experience.</p>
        <p>We’ve covered rackets and their accessories. Choosing the right racket is an individual process. 
             rush your decision, and avoid buying a racket just because your favorite player uses it. 
             Instead, select a racket based on your skill level, body type, and personal preferences, 
             while keeping the tips from this video in mind.</p>
        <p>Many clubs offer racket testing services. Try out several models, play with them, 
            and you’ll surely find the one that brings you joy and helps you earn winning points.</p>
        <h2>Tennis Clothes</h2>
        <p> Let’s look at the specific features of selecting apparel and footwear for our sport. 
            Of course, both clothing and shoes should look great and be to your liking, but that 
            shouldn't be the only criterion for selection.
            Clothing and shoes must be <strong>comfortable</strong>, <strong>functional</strong>, 
            and <strong>suitable</strong> for the environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>Tennis attire typically consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Short clothing: T-shirts, tank tops, shirts, shorts, skirts, or dresses worn during matches.</li>
            <li>Long clothing: hoodies, sweatpants, or training suits used for warm-ups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accessories include caps, visors, headbands, wristbands, as well as socks and tennis shoes.</p>
        <h3>Clothing Selection</h3>
        <p>When purchasing tennis apparel, I recommend choosing synthetic materials, with the exception 
            of socks. Modern, high-tech synthetic fabrics are lightweight, effectively wick moisture 
            away, and are durable.</p>

        <p>Clothing should not restrict your movement. When trying on apparel, 
            perform various movements to see how freely you can move.</p>
        <p>In hot, sunny weather, make sure to have a cap to protect yourself from 
            potential heatstroke and to shield your eyes from the sun.</p>
            <img src="pics/Iga-Swiatek-cap.jpg" alt="Wimbledon Logo" class="content-image">
        <h3>Tennis Shoe Selection</h3>
        <p>When choosing tennis shoes, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <img src="pics/tennis-shoes.jpg" alt="Wimbledon Logo" class="content-image">
        <p>Tennis shoes are specialized footwear.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They feature reinforced sides because tennis involves 
                many lunges and lateral movements.</li>
            <li>They have a firm frame, a sturdy structure, and a strong heel counter.</li>
            <li>Tennis shoes should be <strong>ankle-height</strong> and of 
                <strong>medium weight</strong>.</li>
            <li>They need to withstand the sharp movements typical of tennis, 
                providing stability and protecting the feet from sprains or twists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ensure proper fit.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leave enough space at the back of the shoe to fit one finger. 
                This helps prevent the painful impact of your big toe against the inside 
                front wall of the shoe during sudden stops, which are common in tennis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Match the shoes to the court surface. Selecting shoes designed for the 
            surface you play on will improve your confidence during movement and 
            extend the lifespan of your shoes since wear and tear vary by surface type.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard Court: for hard surfaces.</li>
            <li>Clay Court: for clay courts.</li>
            <li>Grass Court: for natural grass surfaces.</li>
            <li>Omnicourt: for carpet or artificial grass surfaces.</li>
            <li>All Court: universal shoes for any surface.</li>
        </ul>
